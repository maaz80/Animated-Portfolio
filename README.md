# Animated Portfolio

## Overview
I created an **Animated Portfolio** as an assignment, incorporating various animations and advanced visual elements. The project is a showcase of creativity, technical skills, and modern web development practices.

## Project Details
- **Purpose**: To build a visually appealing and interactive portfolio.
- **Approach**: I utilized multiple external references and libraries to craft animated components, focusing on understanding and effectively using code rather than creating every component from scratch.
  - Just like a builder doesn't make bricks when they are readily available in the market, I believe that understanding and applying code is more important than creating everything from scratch.

## Features
1. **Smooth Animations**: Used libraries like `gsap` and `framer` for high-quality animations.
2. **3D Models**: Implemented 3D elements using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`.
3. **Cursor Customization**: Added an animated cursor using `react-animated-cursor`.
4. **Modern Styling**: Designed the UI with `tailwindcss` for a clean and responsive layout.
5. **Interactive Components**: Integrated `react-tilt` and other libraries to enhance user interaction.
6. **Timeline Component**: Used `react-vertical-timeline-component` to present a professional timeline.

## Libraries Used
- **Core Libraries**:
  - React (`react`, `react-dom`): For building the UI.
  - Vite: For fast development and build processes.
- **Animation**:
  - `gsap`: For timeline-based animations.
  - `framer` and `motion`: For motion-based effects.
- **3D Models**:
  - `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`: For rendering and controlling 3D scenes.
  - `three` and `three-gltf-loader`: For loading and displaying 3D assets.
- **Styling**:
  - `tailwindcss`: For responsive and modern design.
  - `postcss` and `autoprefixer`: For CSS optimizations.
- **Cursor and Interactivity**:
  - `react-animated-cursor`: For adding a custom animated cursor.
  - `react-tilt`: For tilt effects on components.
- **Timeline**:
  - `react-vertical-timeline-component`: For a visually appealing timeline.

## Development Insights
- **Time Taken**: Approximately **2.5 days** to complete.
- **Process**:
  1. Explored and researched suitable animated components.
  2. Integrated and customized these components to fit the portfolioâ€™s theme.
  3. Combined various tools and libraries to deliver a cohesive and visually appealing portfolio.
- **Mindset**: 
  - My focus was on leveraging existing tools effectively to build something innovative and unique.
  - I believe in the importance of understanding and utilizing resources efficiently, just like a worker uses market-available bricks to build a house instead of making them.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance animations for a more seamless experience.
- Add custom-made components for a more personalized touch.
- Optimize performance for faster loading times.

**Note**: This portfolio serves as a reflection of my technical expertise and creative thought process, and I aim to improve it further with more time and effort.
